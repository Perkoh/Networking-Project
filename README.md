# Networking Project

## Objective

This project showcases the design, configuration, and security of a robust network infrastructure. It covers key aspects of networking, including subnetting, routing, switching, VLANs, firewall configuration, VPN setup, and network monitoring. The project is designed to provide a hands-on experience in creating and managing a secure and efficient network environment.

### Skills Learned
